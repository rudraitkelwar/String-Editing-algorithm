# String-Editing-algorithm
Write python program for string editing. Demonstrate the use of program for spell checking application
Given two strings str1 and str2 and below operations that can performed on str1. Find minimum number of edits (operations) required to convert ‘str1’ into ‘str2’.

The idea is process all characters one by one staring from either from left or right sides of both strings.
Let us traverse from right corner, there are two possibilities for every pair of character being traversed.

If last characters of two strings are same, nothing much to do. Ignore last characters and get count for remaining strings. So we recur for lengths m-1 and n-1.
Else (If last characters are not same), we consider all operations on ‘str1’, consider all three operations on last character of first string, recursively compute minimum cost for all three operations and take minimum of three values.
Insert: Recur for m and n-1
Remove: Recur for m-1 and n
Replace: Recur for m-1 and n-1
